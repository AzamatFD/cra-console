              synchronous code = in an ordered sequence
			step-by=step linear instructions
			(start now, finish now)
examples:
console.log("yeah")   --> they will run step-by-step one then another
console.log("yeah2")


              asynchronous code = out of sequense
			  access a database; fetch a file; tasks that take time (start now, finish sometime later)
examples:
console.log("yeah")
setTimeout(() => console.log("yeah with time", 5000))
console.log("time")
-
yeah
index.js:3 time
index.js:2 yeah with time
