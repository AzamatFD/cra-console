Variable scope = where a variable is accessible

let = variables are limited to block scope{}
var = variables are limited to a function(){}
global variable = is declared outside any function
(if you put var as an outer variable(global) you will change browser's window properties)


doSomething()

function doSomething(){
  for(var i = 1; i <= 3; i+=1){       --> let i = 1 could only be in these curly braces

  }
}                                     --> var could be displayed only here
console.log(i)   --> you get nothing cuz now i is var, but as an outer(global) variable
