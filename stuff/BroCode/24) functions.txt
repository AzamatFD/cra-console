Function = define code once, and use it many times.
	     To perform some code, call the function name.

startProgram()   --> when you call outer function, it can't get variables from startProgram and then paste them into happyBirthday automaticly,
function startProgram(){                                                                                     so cuz of that you pasted their names in happyBirthday and startProgram below
  let userName = "aza"      --> variables userName & age are known only inside of it's curly braces{}
  let age = 25

  happyBirthday(userName, age)
}

function happyBirthday(userName, age){
  console.log("Happy Birthday to you")
  console.log("Happy Birthday to you")
  console.log("Happy Birthday dear", userName)
  console.log("Happy Birthday to you")
  console.log("You are" + age + "years old")
}
