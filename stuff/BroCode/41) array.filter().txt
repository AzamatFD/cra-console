Array.filter() = creates a new array with all elements that pass the test provided by a function

you are going to create new array of those who is 18 or older:

let ages = [28, 16, 21, 17, 19, 90]
let adults = ages.filter(checkAge)   --> this test will create new array, so you declare it here

function checkAge(element){     
  return element >= 18        --> your text for .filter()
}

console.log(adults)
