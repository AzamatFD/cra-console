pretended that this is grades of students & you gotta sort them 

let grades = [100, 50, 90, 60, 80, 70]      --> 1.step
grades = grades.sort(descendingSort)        -->3.you declare garades to yet sorted grades

function descendingSort(x, y){          --> 2.you create function that sort numbers
  return y - x                              x & y have to compare two elements at a time
}
console.log(grades)    --> 4. you print what you got after sorting numbers
