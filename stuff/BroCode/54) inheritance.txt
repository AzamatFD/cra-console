Inheritance = a child class can inherit all the methods and properties from parent class


class Parent{
  alive = true
  eat(){
    console.log(`${this.name} is eating`)
  }
}
class Rabbit extends Parent{
  name = "rabbit"
  run(){
    console.log(`${this.name} is running`)
  }
}
class Fish extends Parent{
  name = "fish"
  swim(){
    console.log(`${this.name} is swimming`)
  }
}
const rabbit = new Rabbit()
const fish = new Fish()
fish.swim()
console.log(fish.alive)
fish.eat()
