This = reference to a particular object
	the object depends on the immediate context
just imagine that we are replacing this, whith the name of the object

const car = {
  model:"lada",

  brake : function(){
    console.log(`you still drive  ${this.model}`)   --> you can replace it with car.model / will do the same thing
  }
}

car.brake()
console.log(car.model)
