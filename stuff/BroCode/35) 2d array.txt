2D array = an array of arrays


let fruits =     ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"]
let vegetables = ["carrots", "onions", "potatos"]
let meats =      ["eggs", "chicken","fish"]

let groceries = [fruits, vegetables, meats]   --> 2D array

groceries[2][0] = "steak"    --> replased "eggs" with "steak"(first[] for rows, second[] for columns)

for(let list of groceries){
  for(let food of list){
    console.log(food)
  }
