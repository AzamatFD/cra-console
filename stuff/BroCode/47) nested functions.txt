Nested functions = function inside other function. Outer functions have access to inner functions. inner functions are "hidden",
			from outside the outer function. Used in closures.

it's like you are loging in and get information


let userName = "aza"
let messages = 0

login()

function login(){
  displayUserName()           --> but they can be called inside another function
  displayMessages()

  function displayUserName(){             --> these functions can't be called where login() cuz you don't have access to them
    console.log(`welcome ${userName}`)
  }

  function displayMessages(){
    console.log(`you have ${messages} messages`)
  }
}
