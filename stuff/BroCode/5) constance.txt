const = a variable that can't be changed
adds some security to code


const PI = 3.14159;               --> means that this variable won't be changed (write the name of variable with CAPITAL - for practice only, not neccessary)
let radious;
let circumference;

pi = 500;                        --> this assignment won't be accepted, cause u have const PI 

radious = window.prompt("Enter radious");
radious = Number(radious);
circumference = 2 * PI * radious;      --> don't forget about this CAPITALISING
console.log(circumference);
