Console.time() = starts a timer you can use to track how long an operation takes;
			give each timer a unique name
it shows how fast something being run between them:


console.time("responde time")       --> timer names should be the same

setTimeout(()=>console.log("this is it"))

console.timeEnd("responde time")    --> same
